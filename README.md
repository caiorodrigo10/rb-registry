## Quests Core Template

For new projects created with Quests, the AI agent uses a flexible React and TypeScript template that is optimized for agentic use by LLMs. It is capable of creating robust fullstack applications with client and server functionality. The core framework relies on the following primary libraries:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS V4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com/)
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
